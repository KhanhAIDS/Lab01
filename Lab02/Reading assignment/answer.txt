1. When should accessor methods be used?
-To hide the internal representation of the property while expose a property using an alternative representation.
-Controlling the lifetime and memory management (disposal) semantics of the property.
-Allowing inheritors to change the semantics of how the property behaves and is exposed by overriding the getter/setter methods.

2. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category.
Does JAVA allow you to do this?
-No, because in JAVA method overloading can't have multiple methods with the same name and parameters.
